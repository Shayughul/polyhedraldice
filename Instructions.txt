Font Prep
1. Open Photoshop or another image editor
2. Type out the numbers you will need. (1-20, 30-00 in multiples of 10, a second 6 and 9, and an underscore, as well as any logos you will use to replace crits)
3. Select your font, size it to 250pt, and keep it black.
4. Resize your logo, if used, to the same size as the font. 
5. Save your image as a JPG. 
6. Find an SVG converter online and convert your photo to an SVG. 
7. Open Blender. Import the file as an STL. 
8. Convert all your numbers to meshes. 
9. Go into object mode and select all, either by hitting A or by selecting in the layers, NOT by dragging a box around them, or else you will be missing vertices upon extrusion. 
10. Extrude the faces of the meshes with E or under Extrude>Faces
11. Join the 2 digit numbers with their corresponding pairs. (Select both of them and press CTRL J)
12. Rename all the layers to be the numbers they represent. You must do this or the script will not work. (Name your 1 mesh “1” for example)
13. Select all the meshes, right click, and Set Origin to Center of Mass (Volume). 
14. Copy and paste the underscore. Move the second 6 and the underscore to location 0 0 0 by hitting N and changing the values. 
15. Move the underscore down slightly on the Y axis. -.002 is a good place to start. Move it up or down accordingly. 
16. Join the 6 and the underscore. Rename the new mesh to be “6 Line.”
17. Set the origin of the new mesh to be Center of Mass: Volume. 
18. Repeat the process with 9, renaming the second new mesh, “9 Line.” and once again setting the origin to Center of Mass: Volume. 
19. Save your file as “Prepped fonts” or whatever you’ll remember.
